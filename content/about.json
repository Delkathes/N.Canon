    "I'm a self taught Javascript developer. I started learning with free lessons in early 2018 and learned html/css and vanilla JS. After a brief jQuery exploration, I jumped on React as my first Javascript modern framework. And it's been great so far.", 
    "I mostly use Next.js (React SSR framework) and tend to opt for CSS-in-JS solutions for styling. I started using Redux pretty early on my React self-teaching and discovered the Context API later. I switched to React' s Context API and use a hook empowered state manager 'Ã  la' Redux, all being handled by distinct custom hooks.",
    "Server Side Rendering with Next got me to learn Node.js basics. That's how I was introduced to backend development. I now build complete fullstack applications and barely started my journey with Serverless deployments.",
    "My spare time goes essentially into music and guitar playing. Rock'n'roll will never die !"
