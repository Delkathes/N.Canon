  "text": "I'm a self taught Javascript developer. I started learning with free lessons in early 2018 and learned html/css and vanilla JS. After a brief jQuery exploration, I jumped on React as my first Javascript modern framework. And it's been great so far. \n\nI mostly use Next.js for all my work. It offers enough flexibility and ready-to-use features to handle the majority of projects I've built. \n\nServer side rendering with Next.js got me to learn Node.js basics. That's how I was introduced to backend development. I now build complete fullstack applications and barely started my journey with Serverless deployments. \n\nMy spare time goes essentially into music and guitar playing. Rock'n'roll will never die !",
